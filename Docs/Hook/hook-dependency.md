# Introduction to Hook Dependency (On Deployment).

Hooks can have dependencies that must be satisfied before they can be called. The hook management system allows you to specify which hooks should be executed before others, thus creating a chain of dependencies. This is especially useful when you want one hook to perform certain operations before another hook performs its task.

## Usage example

Currently, dependencies between hooks are in the implementation phase. The ability to define dependencies will require appropriate configuration, which we intend to make available in future versions.

> **Note**: The functionality of hook dependencies is under implementation. It may be subject to change in future versions, so please stay tuned for updates.

## How to configure Hooks with dependencies

To configure hookups with dependencies, use the appropriate methods in the hook system. Implementation details will be available in upcoming versions.
